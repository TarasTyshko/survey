<p>Assignment: The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has hired you as a biology team to determine which ecosystems (fresh water, salt water and/or estuaries) should be established on Mars. The CSA will be building a biodome there. You are tasked with researching these three water systems in preparation for an interview with the head of the CSA. He/she will be determining funding for the water systems to be established in the biodome.</p>

<p>Student results should look like the following. Give brief lecture to highlight these points.</p>
<p><strong>Salt Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>covers 71% of Earth's surface</li>
<li>found in oceans, some salt lakes and marshes</li>
<li>more dense than fresh water</li>
<li>greater buoyancy than fresh water</li>
<li>approx. 35,000 ppm of dissolved salts</li>
<li>not drinkable (without treatment to remove salt)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fresh Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>covers 2% of Earth's surface</li>
<li>found in rivers, lakes and streams</li>
<li>less dense than salt water</li>
<li>less buoyancy than salt water</li>
<li>approx. 200-1000 ppm of dissolved salts</li>
<li>drinkable (with treatment)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Estuaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>where the ocean's salt water mixes with fresh river water</li>
<li>resultant mixed water (brackish water) is less salty than the water in the ocean</li>
<li>an area of continual change as the salinity of the water changes with the seasons and climate</li>
<li>if there is a surge of freshwater flowing into the estuary the salinity of water is decreased</li>
<li>during a period of drought the salinity of the water increases</li>
<li>these changes affect both the plants and the animals that dwell in the estuary</li>
<li>very fertile zones</li>
<li>many species of fish and mammals can be found in but do not permanently live in these waters</li>

<p><em>Round 1</em>: Person A is the head of the CSA, Person B is the biologist, and Person C is the reporter.</p>
<p><em>Round 2:</em> Person A is the biologist, Person B is the reporter, and Person C is the head of the CSA.</p>
<p><em>Round 3:</em> Person A is the reporter, Person B is the head of the CSA, and Person C is the biologist.</p>
<p>In each round, the head of the CSA is interviewing the biologist regarding the three water systems (fresh water, salt water and estuaries): what are their characteristics, how they differ, what life forms they support, why we need them all on Earth, why we would or wouldn't need or want them all on Mars, what the biologist would recommend for Mars given CSA budget constraints, etc.</p>

<td width="72%">
<p>Students will conduct an experiment to determine the different buoyancy of fresh water versus saltwater. This experiment will result in a data set which relates to one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes in buoyancy of the same object as different quantities of salt are added to water</li>
<li>buoyancy of different objects in fresh water versus saltwater</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group will have a different object to test: an egg, a nut &amp; bolt, a pen, scuba diver action figure, a chestnut and dice. The objects will be weighed and their mass recorded.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each group will fill a cylinder with 250 ml of water. Students will place their group object in the cylinder, and record where the water line has moved to, indicating the displacement of the object.</li>
<li>Students will add 1 tbsp of salt at a time to the cylinder. After each tbsp of salt, the students will record if the object has moved and if so, will record where the object is on the graduated cylinder. Once the object floats, the experiment is completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group of students will input their data in Microsoft Excel using the SMART board, and then the teacher will tally up and graph the class results of the experiments real-time. Results will then be analysed and discussed.</p>

<p>Jeopardy-style activity using the SMART Board to review covered material. Use the following questions when preparing the board:</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Fresh Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Does fresh water contain a high or low concentration of dissolved salts? (Answer: low)</li>
<li>Question 2: What % of all the water in the world is in the form of fresh, liquid water? (Answer: less than 1%)</li>
<li>Question 3: What does "potable" mean? (Answer: fit for consumption)</li>
<li>Question 4: What are the three forms that fresh water takes? (solid, liquid or gas)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Salt Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: What is the definition of the word "salinity"? (answer: average concentration of salt)</li>
<li>Question 2: What is the salinity of ocean water? (Answer: 3.5%)</li>
<li>Question 3: What % of all the water in the world is salt water? (Answer: 97%)</li>
<li>Question 4: How did the oceans become saltier than the rivers that drain into the oceans or the rain that falls into the oceans? (answer: rocks that contained salt weathered and eroded over a very long period of time)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Estuaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: What is an estuary? (answer: where fresh water and saltwater meet at the mouth of a river)</li>
<li>Question 2: How does the salinity of an estuary increase? (answer: during high tide and periods of drought)</li>
<li>Question 3: How does the salinity of an estuary decrease? (answer: when there is a surge of freshwater in (e.g. during periods of high precipitation or run-off))</li>
<li>Question 4: Do many species of fish live in estuaries? (answer: no)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buoyancy Experiments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Are objects that float positively buoyant or negatively buoyant? (answer: Positively)</li>
<li>Question 2: Aside from the weight of an object, what determines whether it will float or not? (answer: the amount of water it displaces)</li>
<li>Question 3: Is freshwater or salt water denser? (answer: salt water)</li>
<li>Question 4: How much does 1 cubic foot of Fresh Water and Salt Water weigh? (answer: 62.4lbs &amp; 64lbs)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Food Webs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Why must all food webs contain producers? (answer: autotrophs or first level organisms in food chain must produce their own food)</li>
<li>Question 2: What are heterotrophs? (answer: organisms that must consume other organisms for food)</li>
<li>Question 3: What is diversity? (answer: a measure of the number of different species in a given ecosystem)</li>
<li>Question 4: What happens to diversity the deeper you go in an ocean or lake? (answer: it tends to decrease)</li>
