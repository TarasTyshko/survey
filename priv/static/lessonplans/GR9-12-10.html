<p>The students will be place in small group with one handheld device per group. They need to download a QR reader (e.g. I-Nigma | NeoReader | Kaywa) onto their mobile devices. Because the hint for the hunt are text file, the devices don't need to be connected to the internet for this activity.</p>
<p>Display the first intro QR on the whiteboard to get the scavenger hunt started. Students will have to find QR codes placed throughout the school, scan the code which will display a text file with a question on their device and answer it correctly. They will record their answer in a Google Doc and share it with the teacher. The students need to find the most correct answers in the allotted time. This activity with appeal to bodily/kinesthetic learners and put the emphasis on collaborative learning skills.</p>

<p>The students will be given 4 work periods including in-class and in computer-lab time to work on this task. The students will present their final project on the 5th period. One of the work periods will be dedicated for peer-editing. Students will put their draft script in a Google Doc and one other group will have to access the document, read their script, provide feedback and edit their draft before they can start on the final product.</p>
<p>Culminating Task: Students will be creating a short story using their new knowledge of the Pass&eacute; Compos&eacute;. Students will be given a choice of a variety of technologies that they can use to present their short story. Technologies that they can use include: Bitstrips, Powtoon, YouTube Videos, iMovie, PowerPoint, Podcast, Spotify, Audacity, e-pals, etc.. Students are welcome to suggest other technologies that will be approved by the teacher. Students will be assessed on their ability to use the <em>Pass&eacute; Compos&eacute;</em> correctly, the use of agreements, proper grammar (phrase order/prepositions), spelling and vocabulary. Finally, the students will present and share their project with the rest of the class.</p>
