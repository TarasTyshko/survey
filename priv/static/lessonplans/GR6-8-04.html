<td width="72%">
<p>Students will present descriptive paragraph. The presentations may be done in one of two ways to be determined by the teacher based on her/his knowledge of the students and their ability to stay focused on the presentations or to be voted on by the students:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each student presents his/her paragraph to the entire class.</li>
<li>Smaller group presentations where the students would present to classmates in groups of 5 or 6 (this may benefit those students who are not always comfortable speaking in front of a larger group).</li>
</ol>
<p>As the presentations are being done, students are to make a note/list of the personal descriptive adjectives used by each presenter which will be handed in to the teacher upon leaving the class.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture </strong></p>

</td>
<td width="72%">
<p>Students will be introduced to the idea of the importance of the target language for communication, travel and employment. Illicit ideas from students why French is important and use the above three headings to note the ideas on board. Introduce students to concepts of email etiquette and appropriate behavior online.</p>
<p>Introduce the students to e-pals by using a laptop to visually show students the web page in class.</p>
<p>Introduce the project on e-pals &ldquo;All About My New Friend&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will be paired with an e-pal</li>
<li>Over the course of the year/unit (to be determined by instructor) e-pals will ask each other questions to obtain details of their e-pal.</li>
<li>All emails sent to the e-pal are to be sent to the instructor as well to monitor participation, progress, and appropriateness.</li>
<li>Each student will use <a href="http://www.inspiration.com/">Inspiration</a> in order to keep track of information gathered on their e-pal throughout the year. This mind map will be used for their final assignment described in Part 2. Students are to obtain information such as: likes, dislikes, age, hobbies, etc.</li>
<li>Students can use the following link as a guide <a href="http://www.epals.com/projects/all_about/">http://www.epals.com/projects/all_about/</a> to obtain information about their e-pal.</li>
<li>Students will email their e-pal once a week in-class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the e-pals communication will be on-going throughout the school year, the teacher can focus on different aspects of grammar and communication as the year progresses and advise the students accordingly (initially the focus will be on the use of personal descriptive adjectives).</p>
