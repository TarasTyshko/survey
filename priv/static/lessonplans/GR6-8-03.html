<p>Introduce the students to the final project using a video on environmental awareness and the impact of humans on the environment. The video will include an example of sound/music that was chosen to express specific emotions and moods that match appropriately with the visual presentation.</p>
<p>Spark a class discussion with verbal prompts such as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>"How did that make you feel?"</li>
<li>"What was the big idea there?"</li>
<li>"Did you notice the music? How did the music make you feel?"&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Replay the video with no music, and then again with no visual.</p>
<p>Prompt the discussion again:</p>
<ul>
<li>"How does this music make you feel?&rdquo;</li>
<li>"What instruments were used? What types of sounds did they make?&rdquo;</li>
<li>"What did you see when you heard these sounds?</li>

<p>Inform students that they will be making an advertisement video for environmental awareness. Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In groups of 4 or 5, give students time to research different components of environmental awareness such as energy and water consumption, waste production, pollution, loss of biodiversity, and the 3 R&rsquo;s (Reduce, reuse, recycle).</li>

<p>Students can use the following websites to research their topics:</p>
