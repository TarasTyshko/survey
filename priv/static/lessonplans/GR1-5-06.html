<h3>GRADE 5, Science</h3>
<h2>THE HUMAN BODY SYSTEM</h2>

<div class="leftcolumn">

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This lesson plan focusses on the structures and functions of the human body systems, specifically the <strong>digestive system</strong> and its interactions. Through interactive assignments and technology, students will discover how systems in the body work together to meet our basic needs and how our choices effect our organ health.</p>
<p><strong>Topics: </strong>digestive system, organ structures, functions, body systems</p>

<h3>Instructional notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This plan provides a list of supplemental activities to incorporate in to a lesson plan on the human body stems. Activities are listed in a general, flexible sequence which may be altered to meet classroom needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Any written reports or electronic submissions can be evaluated as formative assessments as students have the ability to revise their responses (by taking additional notes or correcting inaccurate responses) for better preparation for final tests or class presentations.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The students will be visiting the following websites in class. These websites may be visited over a period of several days.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Virtual Body: <a href="http://www.medtropolis.com/vbody.asp">http://www.medtropolis.com/vbody.asp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Students can learn the names and functions of the organs in the digestive system, organize the digestive organs, or take a narrated tour of the stomach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Body Quest: <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/10348/">http://library.thinkquest.org/10348/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Students can tour the human body for an overview of the major body systems, stopping along the way to delve more deeply into the digestive system. Students will discover how the digestive system works and find out how each organ contributes to the functioning of the whole digestive system. </p>
<ul>
<li>Human Anatomy: <a href="http://www.innerbody.com/">http://www.innerbody.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Students can click on Interactive Anatomy and choose one of several different anatomy systems then roll a mouse over the system to learn the names and functions of various organs. Or they can choose Anatomy Lessons to tour the human body organ-by-organ.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010821010416/www.stfrancistopeka.org/64trivia.html">Health Trivia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Students will find fascinating facts about the human body and discover a list of truly interesting trivia about the human body. Also the student will be shown the digestive system in 3D view to gain a better understanding of the structure of the organs.</p>

<p>Students will discuss the major body systems and review how those systems function. Students will brainstorm a list of things they do to keep their body functioning smoothly, like exercise. Each student will be asked to write and illustrate one health or safety rule they can follow. These rules will be displayed on the SMART Board with links to their appropriate system.</p>

<p>Students will be divided in groups each representing a specific organ of the digestive system, where they will be asked to prepare a report on the function and structure of the specific system. Students must address the question: What different health problems can arise as results of their malfunction?</p>
<p>Each group will have to submit one report which will be presented at the end of the lesson on SMART Board which will be scored on the basis of a provided rubric. After the presentations, address any misconceptions or new topics students have learned and would like to inquire further about.</p>
