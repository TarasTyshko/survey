<h3>Grade 10, COMPUTER SCIENCE</h3>
<h2>UNDERSTANDING ALGORITHMS: FLOWCHARTING</h2>

<div class="leftcolumn">

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This lesson aims to demonstrate how to use technology to visually represent algorithms using flowchart tools. The lesson plan integrates problem solving, visual representation of algorithms, flowcharting and how it applies to programming. </p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> computer programming, algorithms, flowchart, commands</p>

<h3>Instructional notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This lesson plan is to be used as a supplement to a fundamentals of computer programming lesson/unit.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students will be assessed on how well they can represent an algorithm in a flowchart format. The information being digital will allow the teacher to do so easily. As a summative evaluation, it will be a component to their independent study unit.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div class="rightcolumn">

<div class="box1">
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="checkmark">
  <li>Gain a solid understanding of algorithms</li>
  <li>Understand client-server software and remote storage</li>
  <li>Create and manage online user accounts </li>
  <li>Learn about the concept of online collaboration, revisions, and presentation of ideas</li>
</ul>

<p>Provide and introduction to algorithms in general and how it links to previously covered material and future material.</p>
<p>Algorithms definition: A finite set of unambiguous instructions performed in a prescribed sequence to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Algorithms are the basis for most computer programs.</p>
<p>Discuss how everyday problems can be broken down into simple steps.</p>
<p>Ask: What are examples of everyday problems? Record responses.</p>

<p>Split into small teams.</p>
<p>Each team will take one of the above given examples to break down into simple steps. A couple of volunteer teams will be asked to present their algorithm to the rest of the class, using an overhead projector. The class will point out missed steps, unclear steps or out of sequence steps. This will reinforce the importance of precise algorithms and pre-planning a program to avoid errors.</p>

<p>Students must use the software to individually flowchart another one of the examples treated in class. Walk around to answer student questions and ensure that students have understood how to flowchart. Common questions will be addressed with clarification or further explanation to the whole class.</p>

<p>In teams of 4, students will be given a list of problems (for an example, see the Appendices); they each choose one to develop a solution using a flowchart. Using the flowchart tool, they can create, store and share it with their group members. Teams remain anonymous to which problem they are working on.</p>

<p>Each group will be assigned another team which will peer review their flowchart and provide feedback. Teacher provides a form for each team to capture the feedback. The feedback forms are completed by each team and then returned to the other team. Teams make modifications to their flowcharts based on the feedback they received.</p>

<p>Teams present their flowchart to the class using the projector. The class will be asked to determine what problem they are trying to solve.</p>
<p>Formative assessment will be done by the teacher walking around, inspecting class work, and answering questions. Teams will also be asked to allow their online work to be publicly viewable to the teacher. The teacher can then assess their progress after each day.</p>
<p>Summative assessment will be done through the peer review feedback forms, the class presentations, and the final flowchart products</p>

<p>
eBay Programming Assignment 1: Login Page</p>
<p>Thinking of the eBay login page that you saw in the video and on the eBay.ca website:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a program which will ask a user for their username and password. If they enter both correctly, clear the screen (using cls) and show a welcome message with their username in it.</li>
  <li>With that login program, allow the user three tries at getting the username and password correctly. After 3 tries, clear the screen and tell them to call eBay accounts department to retrieve their password. You should also show how many tries the user has left.</li>
</ol>
