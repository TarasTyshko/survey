<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This lesson plan aims to give students an opportunity to understand the various perspectives that emerged throughout World War II. Students will develop an understanding of how different perspectives will influence a person&rsquo;s perception of the information through developing cultural profiles using internet research and discussing policy through a mock town-hall meeting. </p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> WWII, Canadian history, Wikispaces, Treaty of Versailles, Holocaust, Appeasement</p>

<h3>Lesson Plan</h3>

<p>Lesson Preparation:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the unit, students will be given a passport with a person&rsquo;s bio from the point in time. As the class goes through the unit, students will have to write three separate journal entries from their person&rsquo;s perspective. These students will be grouped together into one of six groups that have similar perspectives (See Chart 1.1). Within the groups, students will be responsible for completing research through the Internet along with being able to use class resources. A Wiki Page will be used in order for the group to enter their research. The page will also update the class and teacher of all the information they have gathered, which will allow for a collaborative learning environment. Each Wiki will have a set of guided questions that will need to be answered, which will help students in guiding their research. These questions will help guide the students to the historical information that should be included in their journals. As well it will help draw the connections to the historical context. Students will have to use information from class as we go through the different topics as well as their research they find on their own. The final aspect will connect all of the various perspectives through a town hall meeting. As a group, students will decide which one of their perspectives they want to take on. In the town hall meeting they will have a discussion the conscription crisis. Each group will be expected to choose one perspective and argue from that point of view.</p>

<p>Lesson will begin with a think/pair/share activity, which will focus on a discussion on what students know about war. This will enable the students to access their prior knowledge and for the teacher to diagnostically assess the students. During the class discussion the teacher can write down some of the student&rsquo;s thoughts about war on the white board. The teacher can address the points raised, either correcting the misconceptions or supporting accurate statements. This hook will lead into the introduction of the new unit, World War II.</p>

Students will be given a chance to look the sheet over in partners and then ask the teacher any questions that may arise. The last part of the class, the teacher will introduce the summative task the students. Students will be shown the different groups and roles that will be able to represent within the project. The teacher will assign the roles to the students, which will allow for differentiated grouping to allow for the best mix of students. With the remaining time, students will get into their groups and have time to discuss the assignment.</p>

The class will deconstruct quotes from Adolf Hitler, which will allow them to gain an understanding of Hitler&rsquo;s beliefs. The main goal will be for students to understand Hitler&rsquo;s perspective and to gain an understanding of why he became who he was</p>

Students will be given a list of websites that will help them find some of the information they will be looking for.</p>
<p>Each group in their wiki page will have to complete a set of questions on their group. For each group they are going to have to find out the primary concerns/issues; their specific role in the war; any stories about their role. In order to provide a historical context, each student will have to incorporate their research in to their personal journal. During the rest of the class time students will have time to begin their research as a group.</p>

<p>Students will be placed in small groups (4 members), which they will rotate through four different stations throughout the class. Each group will stay at one station for 15 minutes each. The stations will ask students to complete a separate activity/task, which will further their understanding of the specific aspect of the home front during World War II. The goal of the lesson is for students to come away with a deeper understanding of the various perspectives on the home front. The first activity will focus on Japanese Canadians and internment. The group will ask students to read a passage front an interned Japanese Canadian and complete a worksheet.</p>
<p>The second activity, students will watch a video called, &ldquo; The Pacifists Who Went to War (http://www.nfb.ca/film/pacifist_who_went_to_war)&rdquo; and completing a cubing activity.</p>
<p>The third activity requires the students to complete a picture deconstruction, which show women&rsquo;s roles during the role.</p>
<p>Lastly, students will complete a mock conscription vote and have a brief reading to complete on the crisis. As students work on their activities, the teacher will walk around to make sure the students are on task and can answer any questions the student&rsquo;s may have. Students are reminded that they should complete their first journal by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Students will have already formed their small groups (4 members) to work on their summative project and will use these two library periods to do research and work on their journals. These work periods will be ideally on a Monday and Tuesday in order for students to receive feedback on their rough copies, which were posted to the class website over the weekend. This will enable students to get the majority of their rough copies and final product completed in class. Allowing them to ask questions of the teacher and ensuring they have a good product. During this time the students can also work in their groups discussing which perspective they will take in the town hall meeting. The role of the teacher during these two periods is to ensure the students are on task, that they understand how to effectively use the technology and give students feedback on their journals. The teacher should also mark down what technologies are being used by the students.</p>

The teacher will assess the students through class participation and the quality of the group&rsquo;s answers and individual answers. This will allow the student&rsquo;s to see the varying perspectives within the class. Overall this will provide a conclusion to the World War II unit.</p>
