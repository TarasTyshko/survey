<p><em>Introduce Shakespeare in Today&rsquo;s World</em> to class. This activity will commence for Act 3, Scene 5. Post the sign-up sheet so students can start signing up for the scenes they wish to perform. This assignment will have students perform in groups (numbers vary depending on number of characters in scene). This activity for the remainder of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is a dramatic reading of the scene they&rsquo;ve signed up for&mdash;done in modern times. The students can be characters of any kind and can perform in any manner (setting can be changed). The only thing that remains the same is the language-- it cannot be changed, though sound effects or minor words/phrases can be added. Students must use cue cards instead of the text. The students&rsquo; individual performances will be peer reviewed. We will take this into consideration when giving each student a mark for Knowledge/Understanding.</p>
