<p>Begin by explaining to students that they will learn how to create colorful graphs by adding data to a computer program called Excel. Have each student watch you as you open the <a href="http://www.educationworld.com/sites/default/files/tastytechtemplate_0.xls">TastyTech template</a>. Demonstrate to students the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click cell A2, where the words "Teacher's Name" are and type your name instead. Explain that the box around your name is called a cell, and that the cell you used is called A2 because it's in column A, row 2.</li>
<li>Ask students to name three of their favorite fast food items, such as a burger, milkshake, chicken nuggets, and so on from a specific restaurant. Highlight the words "Fast Food Item #1," "Fast Food Item #2," and "Fast Food Item #3." Type instead the names of the foods they choose.</li>
<li>Explain to students that you are going to rate the food 3, 2, or 1. A "3" means they love it; "2" means it's okay; and "1" means it&rsquo;s yukky! Demonstrate by putting scores in cells B2, C2, and D2 for each of the food items. (You should have a 3, 2, or 1 in each of those cells.)</li>

<p>Have students open the TastyTech template on their own computers Be sure to put the file on students' computers beforehand, or show them how to access it on the school's network if that's an option.</p>
<p>Call on each student individually, and have students call out their evaluations (3, 2, or 1) for each food.</p>
<p>The rest of the class then types each student's name and score for each food on their own worksheets.</p>
<p>Walk around to make sure students are putting the information in the correct cells and that no student is behind.</p>

<p>When the spreadsheets are complete, have students save and print their work. Next, walk students through the four easy steps of creating a graph of their work. Have them click Insert &gt; Chart at the top of the screen and then</p>
<ol>
<li>For Step One: Make sure "Column" is selected under Chart type, and then click Next.</li>
<li>For Step Two: Click Next.</li>
<li>For Step Three:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Under Chart Title, type "<em>Student Name</em>Fast Food Chart" (Replace Student Name with real students' names.)</li>
<li>Under category (X) axis, type "Names."</li>
<li>Under Value (Y) axis, type "Our Evaluations."</li>
<li>Click Next.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>For Step Four: Click "As New Sheet" and then click Finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each student now should see a graph of the fast food survey results. Students can print the graphs for class work credit.</p>
