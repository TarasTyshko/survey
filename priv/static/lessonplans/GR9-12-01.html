<h3>GRADE 10, DESIGN</h3>
<h2>Architectural DesigN</h2>

<div class="leftcolumn">

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This lesson introduces students to architectural design, interior design, and landscape design. Through creatively designing a bungalow, students will study house layout, building materials, furniture, and landscape components. Awareness of home design criteria will be addressed through research.</p>
<p><strong>Topics: </strong>consumer product design, architectural design, urban planning, mechanical design</p>

<h3>Instructional notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This lesson is to occur in the second half of a design/technology course so students have been exposed to the design process of SPICE, SketchUp modeling fundamentals, and peer reviewing.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Teacher would make anecdotal records throughout the design process based on teacher student interaction.  During the design process the student will be required to perform a number of hands on activities using the design software SketchUp.  Notes would be taken on the students abilities to apply the design process and follow the design criteria to develop the design solution.  The students will be required to think critically of peers&rsquo; designs and give feedback in areas that they need to consider in their design.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div class="rightcolumn">

<div class="box1">
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="checkmark">
  <li>Identify user needs related to specified design criteria</li>

<p>Introduce the project criteria that will include the lot size and maximum coverage as defined by the city and the minimum room sizes as outlined by the building code for their bungalow.</p>
<p>Students are to use the SketchUp software to lay out their rooms, hallways, garage and general house layout:</p>

<p>While the students design their bungalow room layout, the teacher will act as a facilitator during this exercise and assist students when necessary.</p>
<p>Once a room layout plan has been complete by a student, the student will consult with the teacher and discuss how they have designed their bungalow creatively but still worked within the criteria of the project.</p>

Window and door size standards will also be review and the students will use the software to experiment with their position in the house design. The students&rsquo; design will then be reviewed by the teacher for feedback to review the overall design layout before it is to be modeled in three dimensions.</p>

<p>Students will begin the class by doing some research on interior design. The students will use the internet to research the furniture makeup of the various types of rooms. They will then access the Google warehouse to download furniture for their house. The software gives the students the flexibility to both select furniture they desire and position it in the desired area of the house:</p>

Once the student receives their reviews they are given time to make improvements to their design based on the feedback.</p>
<p>Students will be given time to develop a PowerPoint presentation for their design.</p>

<p>As a post design activity the class would create a community.</p>
<p>Combine all of the student&rsquo;s bungalow designs together and create a neighbourhood. This could lead into an urban design unit about components of communities and the various facilities to make them function effectively. Google Earth could be also used as a mindtool in this unit to post street designs or provide a resource to students to research urban layouts.</p>
