<div class="leftcolumn">

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this lesson plan, students learn the elements of a story, how to effectively narrative a story, and how to visually communicate their stories.</p>
<p><strong>Topics: </strong>communication, character, plot, setting, climax, resolution, visualization, storytelling, media literacy</p>
</div>

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Instructional notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that each student has access to Bitstrips for Schools prior to beginning the lesson.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Students will conduct a self-assessment, peer-assessment, and will be assessed on their final product. The teacher will assess the students stories by assessing the characters (if the reader is able to know a lot about them), the setting (very detailed with descriptive words), problem/solution (a problem that goes well with the story), plot/events (interesting and makes sense), word choice, and conventions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div class="rightcolumn">

<div class="box1">
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="checkmark">
  <li>Create a story from beginning, middle, and end</li>
  <li>Sort and classify ideas and information for their writing in a variety of ways </li>
  <li>Produce pieces of published work to meet identified criteria based on the expectations </li>
  <li>Identify an appropriate form to suite the specific purpose and audience for a media text they plan to create.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Discussion (class)</strong></p>
<p>Projector, laptop</p>
</td>
<td width="72%">
<p>Begin reading a comic book story to the class using a projector, ensuring all students are able to read the text and see the pictures in real time. After reading the comic book ask open ended questions that the students will think/ pair/ share with their elbow partner:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you see in the story?</li>
<li>Did anything stand out to you?</li>
<li>Are there pictures in the story?</li>
<li>Were the pictures black and white or coloured?</li>
<li>Did the story have a certain order?</li>
</ul>
<p>By having an open ended discussion in class after the story is read aloud it allows for students to share their ideas about the story and will essentially introduce the big idea of what steps are involved in making a story.</p>
<p>Explain that over the next two weeks students will be creating their very own stories and the final product will be a <a href="http://www.bitstripsforschools.com/">Bitstrip</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="72%">
<p>Introduce story elements. A story is made up of 3 components: beginning, middle and end.</p>
<p>Ask the students questions about the previously read comic book about story elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the main characters? What is the plot of the story? What is the climax of the story?</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading the book, ask the students questions about the recap of the story, such as looking back at the comic book that we just read what was the beginning? What was the middle? What was the end?</p>
</td>

<td width="27%">
<p><strong>Activity (individual)</strong></p>
<p>1 comic book/student</p>
</td>
<td width="72%">
<p>Each student will receive a short comic book to read individually and fill out on a worksheet what the main idea was for the beginning, middle and end of the book, what was the climax, plot, and resolution, and who were the main characters? This will allow for children differentiate between each part of the story, and will allow for the teacher to see if every student has an understanding of how a story line is broken down into parts before moving on to creating their own stories.</p>

<p>Students are encouraged to use the website Kidspiration to create a visual mind map. During their brainstorming process, they can ask their peers or teacher for feedback and ideas.</p>
<p>Prompt: Have the students create categories of &ldquo;Who&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where&rdquo;, &ldquo;What happens&rdquo;, and &ldquo;When&rdquo; on their mind maps and fill these in.</p>
