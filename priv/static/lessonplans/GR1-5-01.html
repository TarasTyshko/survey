<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this lesson students will be introduced to data management through pictographs. Students will review how to sort and organize data before formally being introduced to the terms of data management and pictographs.</p>
<p><strong>Topics: </strong>data management, sorting, primary data, patterning</p>

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Instructional notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Review with students how to properly interact with the SMART board before beginning the lesson</li>
  <li>Carefully monitor student pairs while on the computer to ensure they are staying on task with their partners</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Assessment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Since this is an introductory lesson, there would not be a summative assessment, but there are formative assessments, simply by observing and asking the students questions. By observing and assessing the students while they are interacting with the SMART Board, they will be guided in the right direction by me and allowed to revise and fix their work. This will also allow for an informal peer-review.</li>
</ul>
