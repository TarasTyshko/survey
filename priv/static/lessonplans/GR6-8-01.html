<p>Lead discussion on poetry and music. Suggested introduction: "I will now read you something, I'd like you to close your eyes, and while I read think of the images that come to mind while I read this to you".</p>
<p>Read the lyrics of &ldquo;Imagine&rdquo; by John Lennon. Discussion prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did this reading make you feel?</li>
<li>What did you see while I was reading this to you?</li>
<li>If you had to choose one image to describe this reading, what would it be?</li>
<li>How can we use images to convey emotion?</li>
<li>Does this reading remind you of anything?</li>
<li>Do you think this is poetry?</li>
</ul>
<p>Play the song for the class. Ask if students had different images on their minds while listening to the song with music instead of it being read to them.</p>

<p>Introduce the topic of creating a picture montage to convey emotions. Explain to the students that they will now be developing their own photomontage with PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Have students view this YouTube video of a photomontage made to a song called &ldquo;Where do they make Balloons&rdquo; by Thy Might Be Giants.</p>
<p>Ask what the students like about the montage/what they think/what they would change and why.</p>

<p><strong>Activity (individual) </strong></p>
</td>
<td width="72%">
<p>Have the students think of possible images they can use for a specific song that they chose. Have them write out a list of possible images that they will be able to use for their montage (this is just writing for now not typed the computer).</p>
<p>After students have compiled a list of possible images to use they will now take a closer look at their lyrics and 'pull out' words and phrases that they think are the most moving, important or meaningful to their particular song. They can highlight these words on their printed lyrics. Students will also be encouraged to consider what type of mood is created in their song and the ways that the colours and images they might use can reflect the temperament of the song.</p>

<p>Show students online resources where they can access images. Show them how to save them for their montages (right clicking image, save image as, save to destination).</p>
<p>Students will begin creating their photo music montages.</p>
<p>Instruct students not to be specific at first as this will give them more images to choose from in their searches.</p>
<p>Provide students enough time to compile a collection of images.</p>
