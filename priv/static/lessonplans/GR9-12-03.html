<h2>Quadratic Functions in the Vertex Form</h2>

<div class="leftcolumn">

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This lesson plan focuses on quadratic functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;These functions, in the vertex form, are used to understand the concept of parabolic relations and how transformations and translations affect the shape and positioning of the parabola.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vertex form, y=a(x-h)2+k, will be broken down into its components and each component will be introduced individually.&nbsp;The class will explore what types of situations produce parabolic functions and look at parabolas that are seen in everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Topics: </strong>quadratic functions, vertex form, transformations, translations, coefficient, vertical shift, horizontal shift</p>

<p>Review linear relationships (y = mx + b) and some applications of linear relationships (constant velocity vs. time, distance vs. time, etc.)<strong>. </strong>Review what happens to numbers in general when their values are squared<strong>. </strong>Introduce the basic quadratic relation of y = x<sup>2</sup>. Discuss with the students what they believe the graph is going to look like. Is there anything that they see in the real world that is displayed by using a parabola? Show&nbsp;YouTube video &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN7fzVxUkHo">Who Cares About Parabolas&rdquo;</a> and&nbsp;some photos of parabolas integrated into Geometer Sketchpad &reg; on the&nbsp;SMART board.</p>
<p>Introduce the students to the terminology used in parabolic representation &ndash; vertex, axis of symmetry, minimum, maximum, intercepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask: What will happen to the graph if you have a coefficient in front of the x<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>so that the equation looks like y = ax<sup>2</sup>?</p>
