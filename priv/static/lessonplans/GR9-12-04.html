<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This lesson plan introduces the cell cycle, process of mitosis, and its importance in life and growth. Students will explore the stages of mitosis and will relate it to the development, risk factors, types, and treatments of cancer. Using computer-assisted learning tool WISE, class discussions, and a microscope lab activity, students will collaboratively engage with the cell cycle and gain visual understanding of cell differentiations, mutations and stages. </p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> mitosis, cell cycle, interphase, prophase, anaphase, metaphase, telophase, cytokinesis, cancer, cell division,</p>

Introduce the students to the idea that mitosis occurs in cells constantly in living organisms. Briefly discuss the cell cycle. Highlight that when cells are not dividing they are in Interphase, and they enter mitosis when they are ready to divide. Record key ideas on Smart Board. </p></td>

<td width="72%" valign="top" ><p>In groups of 2-3 students login to <a href="http://wise.berkeley.edu/">WISE</a>: Activity will begin introducing stages of mitosis (Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase, Cytokinesis) starting in interphase. Students are tasked to divide an animation in to mitosis stages and asked how they chose where stages end and the next begin. An online discussion in WISE allows the class o compare how thy chose their stages. Students are provided with definitions of 5 stages and events of each phase. Students are tasked to re-watch mitosis animation and separate it by phase. </p>

<td width="72%" valign="top" ><p>Exercise 1: In WISE, students will review mitosis stages from Activity 1. Task: match labels with pictures of the stages of mitosis. Students are provided with mnemonic to remember stages: It’s (interphase) Pretty (prophase) Much (metaphase) All (anaphase) the Time (telophase) Copying (cytokinesis) </p>

<p>Exercise 2: In same groups as Day 1, students will proceed to WISE Activity 2, Parts of the Microscope. Students will be given a link to a website to learn about microscopes (show on Smart Board what activity looks like and what to do).</p>

<p>Task: read definitions and functions then match the labels to the diagram. Students are to show completed diagram to teacher. WISE will ask students what they would do if a microscope image is too small to see individual cells and what they will do if the image is blurry. </p></td>
