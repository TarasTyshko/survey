<h3>GRADE 11, PHYSICS</h3>
<h2>KINETIC, THERMAL AND POTENTIAL ENERGY</h2>

<div class="leftcolumn">

<div class="maincontent">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This lesson plan addresses the relationship between kinetic energy and potential energy rom gravity and the transfer between them bringing the conservation of energy into focus, as well as the heat energy loss due to friction during real life situations in which the conservation of energy does not hold. Students will analyze, in qualitative and quantitative terms, simple situations involving work, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, and thermal energy and its transfer, using the law of conservation of energy.</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> kinetic, thermal, potential, heat, law of conservation</p>

<p>Students will play a game of Jeopardy using PowerPoint. The activities are composed of two parts. In Part A, each question displays the animation of a target object. Students are to predict the both the initial energy and final energy in the forms of kinetic, potential, and thermal energy. In Part B, the questions display the animations of the interchange of energy from initial to final states. For each energy bar animation, students create an appropriate scenario and provide their rationale. The activities provide learners opportunities to create qualitative connection between concrete events and abstract visual representations.</p>

<td width="72%">
<p>Groups of 3-4 Students participate in a cart and ramp activity: Each student will take turns running the calculator-based ranger (CBR), releasing the cart and recording parameters.</p>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure the mass of the cart on the mass scale.</li>
<li>Connect the CBR unit to the TI Calculator with the unit-to-unit link cable using the I/O Ports located on the bottom edge of the units.</li>
</ol>
<p>Connect the motion detector to the CBR by the SONIC port on the side of the CBR.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stack a few books (or something similar) beneath a wooden board, as shown in the setup diagram. Place the motion detector at the top of the ramp and position the dynamics cart at least 50 centimeters from the motion detector (you will receive spurious results if the motion detector is closer than 50 cm to the moving object). Place the sponge or something soft at the bottom of the ramp to catch the cart.</li>
<li>Measure the height of release of the cart (you can experiment with average value of height) and the height that the cart hits the sponge. It</li>
</ol>
<p>is important that you subtract the height of the cart at the end of the trip from the original height so that the change in height Dh is known to determine the potential energy.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Start the PHYSICS program on the TI calculator.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the main menu select 1. SET UP PROBES and follow the prompts for ONE Probe and MOTION Probe, and then return to the main menu.</li>
<li>In the Main Menu select 2. COLLECT DATA.</li>
<li>In the Data Collection Menu select 2. TIME GRAPH.</li>
<li>Enter in the following values: Enter Time between Samples in Seconds: .05 Enter Number of Samples: 50 Then the calculator will determine how much time the experiment will take. With these values it will take .05 * 50 = 2.5 seconds. You may have to change these values for your particular set up.</li>
<li>Then select 1. USE TIME SETUP. The device is now ready to collect data.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>Hit the Enter button and release the cart. The motion detector will measure the position and velocity of the falling cart. Wait until the calculator is finished with its measurements.</li>
<li>In the Select Graph menu, choose 2.VELOCITY, and a graph similar to the one below will show up. It shows the instantaneous velocity in the</li>
</ol>
<p>y-axis for a given time in the x-axis</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>The graph will have some spikes in the beginning which represent the time when the cart was let go. These can be ignored. The most</li>
</ol>
<p>Important part of the graph is the peak that represents the final velocity right before the cart hits the sponge. The graph is already in the TRACE mode so by using the left and right arrows, place the cursor at the final peak velocity value and read off the y value at the bottom of the screen. The units are m/s. The x value represents the time in seconds.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Calculate kinetic energy (&frac12; mv<sup>2</sup>) and potential energy loss</li>
</ol>
<p>{m*g*(h<sub>1</sub>-h<sub>2</sub>)} and compare results. Perform this calculation for varying heights of the ramp.</p>

<p>The students will then take the data and enter it into an Excel spreadsheet. They will then use Excel to produce graphs which represent the changes in potential and kinetic energy. Using these graphs, the students will produce a report on the cart and ramp activity. The report will be handed in for assessment.</p>
