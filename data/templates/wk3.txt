<p><br>Dear designers, welcome to week 3!  This week we hope you will begin making progress on the specific activities included in your lesson: their sequencing, required materials, and detailed description.  This is section 5 of the wiki, with the aim of section 4.1 and 4.2 to help you add ideas about how the lesson will be student-centered and collaborative.
<p><br>
We have added a set of prompts in the etherpad designed to help you brainstorm and debate ideas with your teammates. Then when you feel that you have some consensus, you can copy and paste anything from the etherpad into the wiki (remember to click Edit and then Save!).

<p><br>
We hope that your peers or MOOC staff will have added some constructive input to the work from last week (keep checking back if nothing is there - it will continually be updated as people add new comments).

<p><br>
Also you may notice an email link at the top left of the Workbench - this is to allow you to email your team, either with ideas or updates. You can hit "reply" to any such emails and your reply will go out only to your teammates.

<p><br>
Good luck this week, thank you again for taking the design strand seriously, and we will see you online!

<p><br>
<i>Jim, Rosemary and the MOOC design team</I>
