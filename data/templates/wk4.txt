Hello designers, and welcome to Week 4!
<p><br>
This week you will try to push on the details of your lesson activity structure, building on any input you may receive from peers. You can try to think about adding the use of smart phones or tablets, referring to the ideas from this week's videos, as well as the brainstorm from your SIG group, found in the "Inquiry Activities" section.

<p><br>
We would also like you to start thinking about assessment.  This is an important aspect to keep in mind throughout the lesson design, and you can discuss and write into your Etherpad and Wiki how the various activities will result in measures of student knowledge and learning.
<p><br>

In order to achieve a detailed design, you may want to work on a "scenario" of one or two students: imagine them working through the lesson, and then write out a description of this.  It will likely help to reveal gaps, or things that need more clarifications.
<p><br>

You may also want to make drafts of the actual worksheets or technology spaces that will be involved.  You can link these into the wiki, either as attachments or links.  You can also start new wiki pages, as necessary, and link them to your page.  Please feel free to ask any questions in the Design Strand discussion.
