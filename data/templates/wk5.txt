<p>Hello designers, and welcome to week 5 of the design strand.  We have added a few new sections to your wiki page, concerned with supporting equity and diversity in the classroom, as well as the enactment of your lesson (concerns the teacher must keep in mind) and assessments.
<p><br>
We have also added a new set of Etherpad prompts, to help you think about the new sections.  Remember, you can all work on the Etherpad as a brainstorm or messy space, then copy and paste into Wiki when you've settled on some good responses.
<p><br>

There is a lot for you to focus on this week, but it represents the completion of our Lesson template.  You can actually work on this for the remainder of the course, but we wanted you to have everything now, in part because we would like to share the designs next week (however complete they may be) with the wider MOOC community, so they can appreciate the fruits of your labor!  So we wanted the design teams to have the complete wiki template, with the chance to add something to each section.
<p><br>

Please remember, this wiki will be available to you even after the course is completed.  We will be sending out usernames and password information next week, and you may even want to stay in touch with your design team to share any experiences trying to enact the lessons.
<p><br>

Thanks again for taking this part of the MOOC seriously.  We have enjoyed watching your progress, and hopefully you have gained from the experience of designing.  We look forward to hearing about your experiences in our closing survey, which we will include next week.
<p><br>

best regards,
<p><br>

<em>Jim, Rosemary and the MOOC design team</em>
