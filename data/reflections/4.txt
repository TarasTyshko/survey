radio,Has the MOOC influenced your thinking about inquiry and technology?
	Very much! I have not considered these ideas before, and find them extremely interesting and helpful
	Yes, somewhat. I had considered most of the ideas before, but hadn’t thought about them as seriously
	Maybe a little bit. It has been worth my time, and I’ve found the materials and activities to be worthwhile
