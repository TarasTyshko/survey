# Feedback to design group
para,Last week, The design teams worked on defining their basic learning goals, topics, possible technologies and approaches - and we gave them feedback.   Now, we would like to help them think about collaboration.  How are their lessons helping students interact with peers and discuss ideas?  What advice or concerns do you have for this team?  How could they add greater levels of productive peer interaction into their lesson?
