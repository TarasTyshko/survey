Overview:  

Please edit your responses to these questions COLLABORATIVELY.  That is, you can all add your ideas below each question, and even build on one another's ideas.  Note, you can choose your own "pen colour" to help differentiate between you.  Also, remember to read one another's comments!  The goal here is to get everyone in the team to start thinking along the same lines, and prepare to develop the specific features of the lesson in coming weeks.
 
Note that it is not necessary to save, all your edits are saved automatically and immediately.
