1. Lets think about collaboration in our designs.  The other MOOC participants or staff may have added some comments about how this could happen.  (see "Constructive Feedback" tab).  How could we improve the role of collaboration?  Can we make it central or important to the students' learning?





2. Take some notes about the detailed lesson design:  What is the basic sequence of activities?  Is there sufficient engagement of students at the individual level, to evoke their ideas?  Is there a final project, design, composition, or other artifact that engages students' understandings and allows for assessment?





3. Consider the specific materials and technology environments.  A good way to do this is to write out "scenarios" that describe the experience of individual students: what they will encounter at each stage in the lesson.  If worksheets or specific technology materials will be employed (e.g., a Google Doc, or NearPod stack, or Pinterest board), it is a good exercise to actually design those materials - at least in a sketch, but preferably the real thing - and upload them as attachments or images to your wiki page.
