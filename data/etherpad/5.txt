1. How will your lesson embrace diversity in the classroom (i.e., as a positive feature, meaning that your lesson is better off for having diversity, and its not a problem to overcome!)  How will it help ensure equity for the various students in the classroom?




2.  How will student progress be assessed?  Try to include the technology-enhanced parts of your lesson into the assessment plan. For example, if students are making drawings or concept maps - how will those artifacts be used for purposes of assessment (formative or summative)?




3. How will the teacher ensure that this lesson goes as planned?  What kinds of hints would you give to any teacher who was going to run this lesson? How should the teacher use her/his time in the classroom most effectively, while the kids are using the technology (hint: its not just to make sure the computers are all working and kids are staying on-task!) What kinds of interactions should the pursue with students?
