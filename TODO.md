TODO

figure out how to transmit state from survey by JS - custom field that is read on receipt
make sure storing and reading survey state works
applying serialized form state back to form on reload
cleaning up css for multi-selects
look at cleaning up generated select names / post-process to make data in db a little cleaner
info page with a nice serialization of questions

--------------------------------------------------
integration:
  - moving from registration to survey - redirect working
  - continuing on survey after logoff - storing page number

devops:
  - better way of doing releases
  - including monitoring in the app

last part:
  - way of visualizing results easily - chartist, likert-graphs. tagcloud for open-ended answers?
  - tests?
  - more robust release handling, running
